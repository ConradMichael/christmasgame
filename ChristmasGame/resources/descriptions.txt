You are in a lightly wooded forest. Candy canes, glittery baubles and what looks like one of Mrs Claus' bra's hang from the branches.

You are in a lightly wooded forest. The snow is falling fast, covering the ground in a thick blanket of snow that makes it difficult to navigate.

The area you are standing in sparkles with ice, creating a magical feeling that is only slightly ruined by the 'vomit icicles' that hang from the tree branches overhead. Presumably left behind after your last nightime adventure.

There is a line of snow-capped trees in the distance, empty cans of XXX Strength Mulled Wine litter the ground.

Snow crunches underfoot. An icy wind begins to blow, carrying faint strains of Slade's 'Merry Christmas Everybody'

You are standing in a patch of yellow snow, you're surrounded by reindeer poop. Reindeer poop as far as the eye can see.

You are standing at the base of a gentle slope, the scent of pine needles and moonshine surrounds you.

You are standing at the top of a small hill. below you is a frozen pile of clothes and an impression left in the snow by 4 or 5 randy elves.

You are standing by a frozen lake. In the centre can still be seen the vague silhouette of 'Glitter-toes', the unfortunate elf who fell in the lake and got trapped under the ice 3 years ago.

You stand on a barren, frozen plain. The plain horizon stretches far into the distance. Standing here it feels as if you are the only person on earth... from somewhere you hear the faint sounds of 'Baby Shark'!

The magical green glow of the northern lights shines majestically overhead. A gentle breeze caresses your beard and snow falls gently down around you, covering the earth in an unblemished, white blanket.... you slip in reindeer shit.

As you pass a pine thicket you see something carved into the bark of a pine tree "Fucking cold and fucking dark. Listen to the huskies bark. - Lapland Winter. A short poem by Sugar-Socks McJingles"

Half eaten mince pies and empty bottles of Brussel Sprout flavour WKD litter the ground. Signs of another elf bender that got out of hand.
